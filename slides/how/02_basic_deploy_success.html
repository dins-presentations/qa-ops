    Просто берем и обновляем версию сервиса

    Your app/service is not business, mission or revenue critical OR
    You’re deploying out-of-hours and no one is using the app/service OR
    Your ass won’t get fired if the app/service fails OR
    You’re still living in the stone-age
    Pros: Simple, fast, cheap
    Cons: Risk, outages, slow rollback, unemployment

    I laugh at this now, but when I was a developer back in 2004 this is how we rolled.
    We’d basically get someone in Ops to update the servers at midnight and then all pray before we went to bed. Hopefully,
    when we showed up at work the next morning, everything was good and no one was in trouble.
