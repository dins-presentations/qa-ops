<aside class="notes">
    All nodes within a single environment are incrementally updated one-by-one or in N batches (as defined by a window size) with a new service/artifact version.
    Pros: Simple, cheap, relatively simple to rollback, less risk than basic deployment.
    Cons: App/DB needs to support both new and old artifacts. Manual checks/verification at each increment could take a long time.
